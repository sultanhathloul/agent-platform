# Architecture Decision Log

Append-only. Never rewrite or delete a past entry. To change a decision, add a new entry that supersedes it and reference the old one by number.

Closed decisions in `README.md §2` and `§18–§20` are not repeated here. They are the baseline, and entries below refine or extend them.

Entry format:

## Decided

Choices confirmed by the owner.

ADR numbers 0006–0010 follow the owner's decision numbering (decisions 6–10); 0001–0005 are unassigned.

### ADR-0006: Permission naming is `cap:{slug}` and `kb:{slug}:read`
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: decided
- Context: README §5.1 and §11 named permissions `tool:sql`, `tool:web`, `tool:docs`, while §5.3 and §18.2 gate capabilities with `cap:{slug}`. Two names for one concept.
- Decision: A capability is gated by the realm role named in its manifest `permission`, always `cap:{slug}`. A knowledge base is gated by `kb:{slug}:read`. `cap:general` is a composite child of the base `user` role, so every user has it. The `tool:*` permission naming is dropped everywhere. README §5.1 and §11 are patched to match.
- Consequences: The gateway puts only `cap:*` and `kb:*:read` roles into `permissions[]`. Tools inside a capability are authorized by the capability's permission plus `PRE_TOOL` policies, never by per-tool roles. Open point: `tool:{name}` also appears as a guardrail policy *scope* (§10.1, §18.1, §18.4). That is not a permission and was left unpatched. It must be settled before phase 03.

### ADR-0007: `make test` uses LiteLLM with mock responses
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: decided
- Context: Tests must be deterministic and offline, but rule 6 forbids bypassing Context Assembly or LiteLLM, even in tests.
- Decision: `make test` sends every model call down the production path (Context Assembly → `models.call` → LiteLLM proxy) to a LiteLLM instance whose aliases return `mock_response`. Real models are used only in `make eval` and `make smoke`. No test may call a model endpoint directly.
- Consequences: `make test` needs Docker for the mock LiteLLM container. Tests show that the pipeline works, not that the answers are good; model quality is covered only by evals.

### ADR-0008: Development model defaults
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: decided
- Context: README §2 lists dev defaults and allows "the largest model the host can run" for `heavy`.
- Decision: `fast` = `qwen2.5:3b`, `standard` = `qwen2.5:14b-instruct`, `heavy` = `gemma4:31b` (already on the development host; tiers may mix model families), `embed` = `bge-m3`, `rerank` = `bge-reranker-v2-m3`. The only mapping lives in `infra/litellm/config.yaml`. Python tooling is `uv`.
- Consequences: `heavy` is a different model family from the other tiers, so prompts must not rely on Qwen-specific formatting. `bge-reranker-v2-m3` is not in the Ollama library, and Ollama has no rerank API. How it is served is decided in phase 04, the first phase that reranks.

### ADR-0009: Phase 01 scope
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: decided
- Context: §15 phase 1 is short. Four scope questions were settled with the owner.
- Decision: (1) A minimal assembler sits behind the real `ContextAssembler` interface and emits per-block token counts. The full pipeline is phase 02. (2) Compose includes ClickHouse and the OTel collector from phase 01. (3) `scripts/smoke.sh` grows each phase: each phase adds checks and none are removed. (4) Guardrails have seven checkpoints: the six in §10.1 plus `MODEL_TIER` (§19.3).
- Consequences: Phase 01 defines all seven checkpoints as pass-through hook points (graph nodes, broker, tier resolver). Phase 03 fills in the engine without moving them.

### ADR-0010: Repository layout and service boundaries
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: decided
- Context: README §4 and §9 placed capability code under `tools/<name>/` and prompts under `models/prompts/`, which contradicts §18 and CLAUDE.md. §2 also left a FastAPI gateway open as an option.
- Decision: Follow §18 and CLAUDE.md. Capability code lives only in `services/agent/app/capabilities/<slug>/`. `app/rag/` is a shared core library that capabilities import. Prompts live only in `config/prompts/` and `capabilities/*/prompts/`; `models/` holds a loader, not prompts. The gateway is Spring Boot 3 on Java 21; the FastAPI-gateway option is closed. `tenant_id` comes from the Keycloak user attribute `tenant_id`, mapped into the token, and defaults to `default` when absent.
- Consequences: README §4, §9 and §11 are patched to match. Keycloak's declarative user profile must declare `tenant_id` as an admin-managed attribute.

## Assumed

Places where the spec was silent. We picked the simplest option that fits the architecture, and the owner may overturn it.

### ADR-0011: Browser login with oidc-client-ts; the browser calls the gateway directly
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: §13 allows next-auth or oidc-client-ts. The `web` client is public with PKCE (§11). Inside the web container, the browser-facing Keycloak URL is unreachable.
- Decision: oidc-client-ts runs in the browser (authorization code + PKCE S256). Tokens stay in sessionStorage and renew with the refresh token. The browser calls the gateway directly under CORS, so no Next.js server sits in the SSE path. URLs are read at request time by the root layout, so one image works for any deployment.
- Consequences: No server-side session, and the gateway is the only token consumer. The gateway must keep CORS limited to the web origin. XSS would expose the tokens in sessionStorage, so a CSP should follow (phase 09 hardening).

### ADR-0012: Token issuer is the browser-facing URL; JWKS is fetched internally
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: Tokens are issued to the browser at `http://localhost:8081`, but containers reach Keycloak at `http://keycloak:8080`.
- Decision: Keycloak runs with `KC_HOSTNAME=<public URL>` and `KC_HOSTNAME_BACKCHANNEL_DYNAMIC=true`. The gateway validates `iss` against the public issuer string and fetches keys from the internal JWKS URI. It never uses issuer discovery. Audience must contain `gateway` (an audience mapper on the `web` client adds it).
- Consequences: Two settings (`GATEWAY_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER`, `GATEWAY_KEYCLOAK_JWKS_URI`) must agree with the Keycloak hostname.

### ADR-0013: Gateway runtime, SSE proxy and audit storage
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: The gateway must stream agent SSE unchanged (§6.1.6), keep one trace per turn (§12), and write one audit record per turn (§16).
- Decision: Spring MVC runs on Java 21 virtual threads, and the proxy runs on the request thread, so the trace context carries into the agent call and `traceparent` propagates. The upstream is a JDK HttpClient (HTTP/1.1) that forwards lines unchanged and flushes at each event boundary. A mid-stream failure appends one `error` event (`agent_stream_interrupted`, `seq: -1`). Audit lives in schema `gateway` of database `app` (Flyway). A trigger rejects UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE. Statuses are `ok`, `error`, `denied`, `aborted`; requests rejected by validation are not audited.
- Consequences: The `app` role owns the table and could drop the trigger. True immutability needs a separate insert-only role (phase 09). `/v3/api-docs` is public in compose; disable it with `SPRINGDOC_API_DOCS_ENABLED=false` in production.

### ADR-0014: `general` contributes no findings; the answer node makes the only model call
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: UC5 is "direct model answer, no tools", and every capability must run through the §18 contract. If both `general` and the answer node called the model, general turns would cost two calls.
- Decision: The `general` subgraph returns an empty finding and makes no model call. The core `answer` node answers, on the tier floor of the selected capabilities. When a call is made on behalf of capabilities, the highest capability floor (with per-step overrides) replaces the role's provisional default. Other calls use the role default (§19.1). The answer budget is capped by the largest `max_input_tokens` of the selected capabilities.
- Consequences: General questions use one `fast` model call. The same path serves turns where several capabilities contribute evidence.

### ADR-0015: Routing rules gain `fallback`; the router model arrives with the second capability
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: §18.2 lists `toggled` and `keyword` rules. With one capability, a router-model call would decide nothing.
- Decision: The manifest rules are `toggled`, `keyword` (matched after Arabic normalization), `attachments` and `fallback`. `fallback` capabilities are chosen only when no other rule matched; `general` declares it. `toggled` matches nothing until the turn request carries capability toggles (phase 05). The 3B router model is added in phase 04, the first phase with two capabilities. Arabic normalization lives in `app/text/arabic.py` so the router, the `keyword_list` checker and chunkers can share it.
- Consequences: General turns cost no router call. Phase 04 adds a router step for when rules leave several candidates.

### ADR-0016: AgentState additions and in-memory checkpointing in phase 01
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: §5.1 has no place for per-turn ids, locale, capability outputs or capability state namespaces (§18.2).
- Decision: Four fields are added:
  - `turn_id`: used in event envelopes and, from phase 02, the debug context lookup.
  - `locale`: selects the prompt locale.
  - `capability_outputs`: read by `answer` and `validate`.
  - `cap_state`: a dict keyed by `manifest.state_namespace`. `run_capabilities` hands each capability only its own slice.
  `persist_state` appends the finished user/assistant exchange to `messages`, so the window never contains the current message. Phase 01 uses LangGraph's `InMemorySaver`; the Postgres checkpointer replaces it in phase 02.
- Consequences: Conversation history is lost when the agent restarts until phase 02.

### ADR-0017: `models.call` takes a ContextPackage and a TierDecision
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: Rule 6 requires every model call to go through Context Assembly. §19.2 shows `models.call(role=..., step=..., messages=...)`.
- Decision: The gateway accepts only an assembled `ContextPackage` plus the resolver's `TierDecision`, and it rejects a package assembled for a different tier. The call flow is resolve tier → budget → assemble → call. Calls always stream; usage comes from LiteLLM (`stream_options.include_usage`), estimated only when it is missing.
- Consequences: Raw messages cannot reach a model by construction. The resolve/assemble/call sequence is explicit at each call site.

### ADR-0018: Token counting with tiktoken o200k_base, baked into the image
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: Budgets need token counts for Qwen and Gemma, and the runtime must work offline.
- Decision: `TiktokenCounter("o200k_base")` is a model-agnostic estimate, behind a `TokenCounter` protocol. The encoding file is downloaded at image build (`TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR`). Billing-grade counts come from model usage.
- Consequences: Budgets are estimates, and the tier budget keeps headroom (`reserved_loop_headroom_tokens`). An exact per-model tokenizer can replace it behind the same protocol.

### ADR-0019: Test harness layout
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: ADR-0007 requires tests to go through LiteLLM, and the host has no JDK 21.
- Decision: `litellm-mock` (same image, `infra/litellm/config.mock.yaml`) and `agent-tests` run under the compose `test` profile. Gateway and web tests run in the `test` target of their Dockerfiles. Locally, `uv run pytest` reaches the mock on port 4001. Integration tests fail, never skip, when the mock is unreachable. A test tracer provider with an in-memory exporter asserts span attributes, including the context block token counts.
- Consequences: `make test` needs Docker only; no host JDK or Node is required.

### ADR-0020: Configuration files added in phase 01
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: Several phase 01 behaviours need data that §20 says belongs in files.
- Decision:
  - `config/context.yaml` holds the Context Assembly pipeline order, window size, headroom and per-node needs/system prompt.
  - `config/messages/errors.yaml` holds agent error texts (ar/en). The gateway's texts live in `messages_{ar,en}.properties`, and the web renders its own `errors.<code>` strings, falling back to the server message.
  - A capability that needs the `system` block must ship a `<slug>.system` prompt. This is checked at startup.
- Consequences: Adding a context step or a node is a config change plus one class.

### ADR-0021: Observability defaults
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: §12 hashes user ids but says nothing about prompt content in traces.
- Decision:
  - `OBSERVABILITY_CAPTURE_CONTENT=true` by default: generation spans carry messages and output, and the trace carries the user message and the answer.
  - User ids are HMAC-SHA256 hashed with `USER_ID_HASH_SALT`.
  - The gateway excludes probes and API docs from traces, and turns off Spring Security observations.
  - The `context.assemble` span carries `context.block.<name>.tokens` plus JSON metadata `block_tokens` and `context`.
  - Langfuse, LiteLLM and Next.js telemetry are off.
- Consequences: Traces contain user text. Set capture to `false` where Langfuse must not hold content.

### ADR-0022: Infra details the spec left open
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: §14 names services, not their wiring.
- Decision:
  - **Postgres:** one owner role per database (`app`, `business`, `keycloak`, `langfuse`).
  - **MinIO:** bucket `kb` became `kb-docs`, because S3 bucket names need at least 3 characters.
  - **LiteLLM:** runs without a database. `heavy → standard` is its only fallback, because a fallback below `standard` would break the risk floor.
  - **Ollama:** `num_ctx` is set per alias so prompts are not silently truncated; the dev `heavy` window is 65536.
  - **Keycloak:** runs `start --import-realm` (production mode, HTTP enabled), and the realm file uses `${ENV}` placeholders for the web URL and the gateway client secret.
  - **Langfuse:** uses the MinIO root credentials.
  - **Login in tests:** `scripts/get_token.py` performs the real PKCE browser flow for smoke and eval, so the realm has no direct-grant client.
- Consequences: Human review needed: the realm export (service-account `realm-management` roles), the LiteLLM aliases and `num_ctx` values, and MinIO credential scoping for Langfuse (a dedicated key is better, phase 09).

### ADR-0023: Empty state digest omitted; short answer prompt
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: assumed
- Context: §7 includes the state digest "always". On a first turn, the digest can only say "Turn: 1". Measured through LiteLLM on the fast tier against the `general` suite (8 cases):
  - `answer.system@1.0.0` plus that digest: 2/8.
  - The long prompt's rule "if the user writes in Arabic, answer in Modern Standard Arabic" made the fast model answer English questions in Arabic, even when called directly on Ollama.
  - A short prompt with the digest: 5/8. The short prompt alone: 6/8.
- Decision:
  - The digest step emits a block only when there is something to report (selected KBs, decisions, open threads, artifacts). It no longer includes the turn number, which §7 does not list.
  - `answer.system@1.1.0` is a short instruction set. The permitted tool list renders only when the node has tools; evidence and policy-hint sections render only when present.
- Consequences: A first-turn context holds the system and user blocks only. The digest reappears on its own once phase 02 adds decisions and open threads. Prompt changes keep being measured against the eval suites (§20).

## Proposed

Arguments against a closed decision. The current decision stays in force until the owner accepts a proposal.

### ADR-0024: The fast tier misses the Arabic general-knowledge eval
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Phase: 01
- Status: proposed
- Context: README §19.4 puts `general` on `min_tier: fast`, and ADR-0008 maps `fast` to `qwen2.5:3b`. The `general` suite (5 Arabic and 3 English cases; `contains_any`, `excludes_any` and script checks) has a 0.85 threshold. Measured through LiteLLM with `answer.system@1.1.0`:
  - `fast`: 6/8 and 5/8 on two probe runs, and 5/8 (0.62) in `make eval` through the full stack.
  - `standard`: 7/8 (probe).
  The failures on `fast` are wrong Arabic facts (flag colour, largest ocean) and an occasional reply in Chinese. Prompt fixes (ADR-0023) closed most of the gap; what remains is model capacity.
- Decision (proposed, not in force). One of:
  - (a) **Recommended.** Replace the `fast` model with a stronger small Arabic-capable model, keeping §19.4. Every helper role (router, summarizer, judge, extractor) also runs on `fast`, and the `llm_judge` checker is the primary Arabic topic filter (§10.2), so they would all gain too. The candidate would need to be pulled (with owner approval) and measured on this suite first.
  - (b) Set `general.min_tier: standard`, overriding §19.4. Each general turn gets slower (not yet measured).
  - (c) Keep both, and lower the `general` threshold to what `fast` achieves, accepting weaker general answers.
- Consequences: Until the owner decides, `general` stays on `fast`, the threshold stays at 0.85, and `make eval` fails. Phase 01 cannot be marked done.
